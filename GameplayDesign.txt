# Weathered: Game Design Document

## Core Concept

Weathered is a top-down action RPG that draws inspiration from classic MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) while implementing modern real-time combat mechanics. Players explore a vast, interconnected world, starting as vulnerable adventurers in a safe town before venturing outward to face increasingly dangerous challenges, gather powerful equipment, and develop their unique character builds.

## World Structure & Exploration

### Stage-Based World Design

- **Interconnected Stages**: The world is divided into discrete stages of varying sizes connected by exits
  - **Towns/Hubs**: Large, multi-screen areas containing essential services (shops, banks, inns, temples)
  - **Interior Spaces**: Small, single-screen areas for shops, houses, and other buildings
  - **Wilderness Areas**: Expansive, multi-screen areas containing dangers and connections to other regions
  - **Dungeons**: Challenge-focused areas with unique enemies and valuable rewards

- **Complex Web of Connections**: Areas connect in non-linear ways, encouraging exploration
  - **Bidirectional Exits**: Most exits connect back to their origin point
  - **Hidden Passages**: Secret areas accessed through special actions or items
  - **Shortcuts**: Paths that can be unlocked from one side to facilitate faster travel
  - **One-Way Exits**: Some paths only work in one direction, creating interesting traversal challenges

### World Generation Philosophy

- **Hybrid Approach**: Blend of hand-crafted and procedurally generated content
  - **Consistent Core**: Major towns, quest hubs, and story locations remain fixed across playthroughs
  - **Dynamic Wilderness**: Forests, caves, and other wilderness areas use procedural generation
  - **Seeded Generation**: Important procedural areas maintain consistency for key game elements

- **World Persistence**: Player impact on the world remains between sessions
  - **Discovered Areas**: Remain mapped once found
  - **Unlocked Shortcuts**: Stay accessible after activation
  - **Defeated Bosses**: Remain defeated (unless purposefully reset)

### Travel & Navigation Systems

- **Teleportation Network**: Fast-travel system requiring prior discovery of locations
- **Movement Abilities**: Skills, spells, or items that enhance traversal capabilities
- **Mounts**: Creatures that increase movement speed and may provide special traversal abilities
- **Maps & Wayfinding**: Tools to help navigate the complex world

## Combat System

### Real-Time Action Combat

- **Combat Style**: Real-time action combat inspired by games like Hades, adapted for an open world
