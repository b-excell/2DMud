# FIERYWILDS: Game Vision Document

## Core Concept
FIERYWILDS is a top-down action RPG that draws inspiration from classic MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) while incorporating modern real-time combat mechanics. Players explore a vast, interconnected world, starting as vulnerable adventurers in a safe town before venturing outward to face increasingly dangerous challenges, gather powerful equipment, and develop their unique character builds.

## World Design

### Structure
- **Towns**: Safe hubs featuring essential services (shops, banks, temples, training grounds, quest givers)
- **Connected Areas**: Small, discrete zones accessed via "exits" from larger areas
- **Danger Zones**: Areas with progressively difficult enemies as players venture farther from civilization
- **Landmarks**: Unique, memorable locations that help with navigation and world immersion

### Generation Philosophy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Blend of hand-crafted and procedurally generated content
- **Consistent Core**: Major towns, quest hubs, and story locations remain consistent across playthroughs
- **Dynamic Wilderness**: Forests, caves, and other wilderness areas use procedural generation for fresh experiences
- **Persistence**: Some player impacts on the world remain between sessions (discovered shortcuts, defeated bosses)

## Character Progression

### Skill-Based Development
- No predetermined classes at character creation
- Character skills improve through use (combat skills, magic schools, crafting)
- Stat distribution affects equipment options and ability effectiveness

### Combat Styles
- **Fighter**: Direct combat with various weapon types, defensive abilities
- **Assassin**: Stealth, critical attacks, evasion, poisons
- **Mage**: Various spell schools with different utility and damage patterns
- **Druid**: Shapeshifting, companion creatures, nature-based abilities
- **Hybrid Builds**: Encouraged through balanced stat requirements and complementary skills

## Gameplay Systems

### Combat
- Real-time action with positioning and timing importance
- Resource management (health, stamina, mana)
- Various attack patterns and enemy behaviors requiring different tactics
- Difficulty based on enemy AI rather than inflated stats

### Enemy AI Variety
- **Passive**: Creatures that flee when approached or attacked
- **Neutral**: Entities that only become hostile when provoked
- **Territorial**: Enemies that attack when players enter their domain
- **Aggressive**: Monsters that actively hunt players within their area
- **Special Behaviors**: Ambushes, pack tactics, environmental interactions

### Death & Recovery
- Upon death, player respawns at last visited town
- Equipment remains on corpse, requiring recovery expedition
- Limited inventory retained upon death (equipped items or essentials)
- Possible gold/experience penalty to add consequence

## Technical Implementation

### Stage System Enhancement
- Town stages with structured NPC placement and services
- Special exit types (doors, gates, portals) with visual distinction
- Consistent stage connections for major areas
- Dynamic stage generation for wilderness and dungeons

### Multiplayer Considerations
- **Initial Phase**: Single-player with possible asynchronous elements
  - Player ghosts or messages
  - Shared leaderboards
- **Stretch Goal**: Limited multiplayer
  - Small party co-op (2-4 players)
  - Shared world instances
  - Simplified trading mechanics

### Content Creation Pipeline
- Tools for designing hand-crafted stages
- Rules and parameters for procedural content generation
- Testing methodology for difficulty progression

## Artistic Direction

### Visual Style
- Minimalist but distinctive representation of characters and environments
- Clear visual language for danger levels and interactive elements
- Readable combat interactions even with multiple entities

### Audio Design
- Ambient sounds to enhance environment immersion
- Distinctive audio cues for different enemy types and behaviors
- Dynamic music system reflecting danger levels and player status

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Core movement and stage transition mechanics âœ“
- Basic combat system
- Initial town and surrounding area
- Character stats and inventory

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Multiple towns and connecting areas
- Enemy AI patterns
- Skill progression system
- Equipment variety

### Phase 3: Depth
- Quest system
- Crafting and economy
- Special encounters and boss fights
- World persistence

### Phase 4: Enrichment
- Additional combat styles
- Environmental hazards and interactions
- Enhanced procedural generation
- Prototype multiplayer features

## Conclusion

FIERYWILDS aims to capture the sense of exploration and danger from classic MUDs while providing the engaging real-time combat of modern action RPGs. By blending procedural generation with hand-crafted content, the game offers a vast world to explore with the excitement of discovery and the satisfaction of character progression through meaningful choices rather than predetermined paths.

The primary design goal is to create an immersive world where player skill, knowledge, and decision-making determine success, rather than grinding or artificial restrictions. A world that feels alive, responsive, and worthy of exploration.
