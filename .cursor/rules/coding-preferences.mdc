# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Stick with established patterns if at all possible.
- Keep performance in mind.
- Keep multplayer functionality in mind.
- Try to write the solution first before restorting to an external library.
- Work with the game engine instead of coding around it.
- Use the Entity/Component pattern expertly.
- Do not allow files to become more than 200-300 lines. Refactor when necessary to keep files small and concerns seperate in a logical way.
- Mention unused or depricated code whenever you encounter it, suggest edits to keep the code clean.
- Keep our file structure clean, logical, and tidy. Reorganize when necessary.
